**Instructions on how to operate this program**

When you run the program, the console will output a welcome message followed by the menu. The menu is as follows:

	1. Add Integer (adds a new integer to the end of the array)
	2. Remove Integer (intakes an index of an array and removes the integer altogether)
	3. Find Integer (check if a certain integer exists in the array)
	4. Modify Integer (modify the value of an integer when called with the index of the integer)
	5. Exit

You will choose your option when prompted (choose 1-5) of whichever one you want to do to the array.
You will be prompted different necessary inputs depending on what choice you make. For example, after you choose option 3
(Find Integer) you will be asked to input the integer you want to find, and so forth.
